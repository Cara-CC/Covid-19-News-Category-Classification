# Covid-19-News-Category-Classification
The number of Covid-19 related news
booms as the pandemic breakout and
spread. When news flood in, text mining
technique could be helpful in efficiently
classifying articles into different genres, so
that news receivers could decide what to
read according to the genre labels. In this
project, two main kinds of text analysis
method will be applied and several
prediction models will be evaluated to
determine a relatively accurate text
classifier.
